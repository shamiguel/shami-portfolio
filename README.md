This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.0.0. One more time

## Project Overview: 
This is a very lightweight version of my 2nd Language Learning project. Instead of focusing on live edits with authentication, I took inspiration from this other existing customizable portfolio template, https://github.com/saadpasta/developerFolio, which only requires a user to input their information via a JSON file. Therefore, this project will primarily be a frontend endeavor and focus on aesthetics, accessibility, and user-friendliness. I plan on creating a detailed how-to page so that individuals with non technical background can set up their own portfolios.
